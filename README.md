## About the Game

Every mission is a **race against time**.

Your base extracts a critical resource for a fixed duration.  
Your goal is to build defenses, manage energy and resources,  
and survive enemy waves until extraction is complete.

**Gameplay focus:**
- constant time pressure
- positional defense
- economy vs firepower trade-offs
- adapting to different enemy types

## World & Lore (Short)

Earth is experiencing an unexplained rise in core temperature,  
triggering global climate collapse. Science, politics, and international
institutions are too slow to respond.

**Project Big Freeze** is a high-risk initiative, backed by the UN,  
aimed at delivering **Samarium**, a rare element capable of stabilizing
planetary core reactions.

During early drilling operations, hostile **Machines** emerge from underground.

They are not random.  
They are not defense.

They are a **test**.

The Machines are part of a universal mechanism known as the **Great Filter** —  
a trial that determines whether a technological civilization deserves to survive.

Now, Earth is next.
